  <div class="about_text">
    <p>For several years since 1991 Michael had been a member of The Little People and Teen Players Club and a founding member of Ashe Caribbean Performing Arts Ensemble (Both are performing arts ensembles in Jamaica).
While a member of these groups, Michael performed an eclectic mix of musical and theatrical styles and toured the U.S., the Caribbean and the UK.
Apart from the training in Acting, movement and choral singing which he received as a member of these groups Michael studied piano, voice and viola privately.
 
In 1996 Michael was accepted on scholarship to Berklee College of Music in Boston. There, he studied voice and pursued a dual major in Music Synthesis and Contemporary Writing and Production and was the convocation speaker at his graduation in May 2000.
 
Directly after, Michael was contracted as the lead male vocalist for 'Holiday on Ice-In Concert'. The show opened in Paris August 2000 and toured Europe, for three years. While on tour he had the opportunity to perform with several popular European artistes including: Leo Sayer, Petra Berger, Cheb Mami and Patricia Kaas.
 
Michael has been teaching as well as writing and arranging. He has co-written songs for popular artists at home and has a song in heavy rotation on Caribbean Radio. He is now exploring the recording and production aspects of music as well as performing.
 
Through his creative partnership JOY MECHANICS, Michael and longtime friend and collaborator Michael Holgate have produced 2 albums and since August 2012 have stage an annual Wolrd-Alternative music and arts festival- ‘Gungo Walk’  
 
He is the Assistant Director for the School of Music at the Edna Manley College, where he has also taught Pop/Jazz voice and Jazz harmony and has recently co-written a music technology course for their degree programme.
 
Michael has also become a primary consultant with Digicel Rising Stars, acting as performance coach for all the selected artistes. He also works closely with the creative team with song selection and overall creative choices.
 
Michael recently graduated with a masters degree in Music Technology Innovation from Berklee College of Music’s Valencia campus.</p>

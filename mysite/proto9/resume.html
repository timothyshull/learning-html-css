              <h3><span>Summary</span></h3>

              <p><span>I am a web developer, a musician, and a music technologist. I recently completed a master&#8217;s in music technology and my interests and expertise include JavaScript development, music production, programming for sound design and synthesis applications, and computer-based sound installations and performance. I am also highly capable and experienced working with data; I have a bachelor&#8217;s degree in mathematics and worked for over 5 years as a paraprofessional accountant and systems support technician.</span></p>

              <p><span>Since completing my master&#8217;s degree, I have furthered my education in web development and programming through self-guided study and am eager to establish a career in this field to continue learning in a professional environment. I am self-motivated but enjoy a team environment and look forward to the new experiences a position as a web developer could offer.</span></p>
              
              <p><span>I would love to speak with you about what I can contribute to your organization. Please contact me at timothyshull@gmail.com.</span></p>

            <h3>Recommendations</h3>

            <h5>John Horrocks, manager at BlackBird Frame and Art</h5>

            <p>Smart and personable, reliable and enthusiastic. Tim is self-motivated, actively interested in studying a problem to seek a solution. He possesses the intellect to not only discover an answer but to effectively articulate his recommendations. He always accepted non-routine assignments willingly and approached every task with unusual energy. We were fortunate to have Tim as an employee, but always knew his destiny lied beyond our door.</p>

            <h5><span>Benjamin Cantil, professor at Berklee College of Music</span></h5>

            <p><span>In the time I&rsquo;ve known Tim during last school term, he was an extraordinary leader in our department, and one of the most technically literate and creatively charged students on our campus.</span></p>

            <p><span>As a technologist, Tim has an intuitive sense of picking up new programs. He is the type of inquisitive mind that is not simply satisfied with knowing how something works, but he also insists on figuring out why it works, and how to make it better. He was a leading innovator in our program, with ideas that expanded beyond the classroom content and down to the coding level of many programs we were using only on the surface.</span></p>

            <p><span>As an artist, I recall an occasion where I was positively moved to speechlessness by a deeply soulful electronic-acoustic tune that a friend randomly had me listen to. It was not until the end of the song when I was informed that the piece of music was actually a composition of Tim&rsquo;s. Tim&rsquo;s creative intelligence is as vast as it is rare, and his musical gifts are an inspiration to students and teachers alike. Even more rare are those who have an intellectual capacity to break down and describe the mechanics of his process such as Tim does. Even sitting with him for five minutes will clue you in to the ocean of creative potential beneath the surface of this artist.</span></p>

            <p><span>On top of his talents, Tim is easy to relate to and an all around great guy. During the school term he was elected by his peers to be a representative for his program, because everyone got along well with Tim and he actually listens when you speak to him.</span></p>

            <p><span>Tim comes with my highest recommendation of any student I taught in this term.</span></p>

            <h5><span>Wayne Kemp, voice teacher at Levine School of Music</span></h5>

            <p><span>Mr. Shull studied voice with me for approximately two years, 2010-2012. In addition to possessing a fine voice, he was steadfast and undaunted by the musical and linguistic challenges of classical vocal music. He has a cheerful and curious attitude, and always completed his assignments in far less time than expected.</span></p>

            <p><span>Furthermore, Mr. Shull presented a wide range of musical curiosity, frequently creating his own exercises for ear training and complex aural skills. He also explored in depth the physics of acoustics, resonance, and linguistics in a manner that I have never witnessed from a singer before or since.</span></p>

            <p><span>I had such confidence in Mr. Shull’s musicianship that I engaged him as my own guitar teacher. His analysis of my goals and abilities was impeccable, and he designed exercises for me that completely meshed with my understanding of theory, which is based in my own bachelor’s degree in piano performance.</span></p>

            <p><span>Mr. Shull was absolutely reliable in his preparation for and attendance of lessons. His inquiries were astute and frequently surprising in their technical prowess. His is a mind that you have to run to keep up with.</span></p>

            <p><span>[sic]I am happy to attest that I am a better musician for having worked with him both as teacher and student.</span></p>

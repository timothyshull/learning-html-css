##Projects

###Wages
This is a project that I am currently working on [Wages Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/263433887/wages-seeks-seekers-to-switch-sand-into-sound-and)

###3D Sound
This is a project that I worked on in Spain.  Here I am combining OpenGL with accelerometers to create 3D sound panner in Max/MSP/Jitter.  The sounds were randomly generated water droplets created from an impulse run through filters and then with convolution reverb applied.  The 3D panner controlled the sound of a mosquito or fly that was synthesized using a filtered sawtooth wave that was modeled to account for the Doppler effect.  It was set-up to allow the audience to interact with it.    

###Music 
The music contained in this music player is a random sampling of music that I have worked on.  

This was a fun project that didn't turn out as well as hoped because of technical difficulties [Rule of Three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AbMmuNAJ3Q)

This is the last remaining solid internet remnant of a band that I devoted a good portion of my life to [Bandazian](https://myspace.com/bandazian)

But alas [breakup](http://www.ashvegas.com/breaking-up-asheville-bands-bandazian-barrel-house-mamas)

This was a really fun band with some kick-ass rock musicians. They opened for Band of Horses and Archers of Loaf right after I left Asheville [Cobra Horse](http://mountainx.com/arts/art-news/072209sound_track/)

It was really fun to play upright bass for this amazing songwriter. [Brian McGee](https://brianmcgeemusic.bandcamp.com/)

I lived with and played music with Matt [Matt Rumley](https://myspace.com/mattrumley)

And this is his current project (check it out!) [Her Marigold](http://www.hermarigold.com/)

I also played with this incredibly talented songwriter for a short period of time.  An anecdote that I will probably mention if you ever meet me is that we used to practice in an apartment in the top of Bob Moog's house...somewhat ironically nothing was electrified [Angi West](https://soundcloud.com/angi-west)

###Programming/Development
Beginning in November of 2014, I began working very diligently to learn a number of software and development platforms.  This work has included a lot of studying that combines web development, iOS development, Cocoa/OSX development, language specific studying, and studying of computer science essentials such as data structures and design patterns combined with seeking to better understand the architecture and inner workings of the computer.

I am a web developer, a musician, and a music technologist. I am relatively new to the field of web development, but I have traversed a wide breadth and depth of the current technologies since starting in this field. 

As a professional, I have excelled in a number of roles: government contractor for emergency services, carpenter, musician, and accountant. Now I would like to move into a position as a web developer to establish a career in this field and to continue learning in a professional environment.   

My interests and expertise include JavaScript development, music production, programming for sound design and synthesis applications, and computer-based sound installations and performance. I am also highly capable and experienced working with data; I have a degree in mathematics and worked for over 5 years as a paraprofessional accountant and systems support technician.

I would love to speak with you about what I can contribute to your organization. Please contact me through my LinkedIn profile or at timothyshull@gmail.com.

###Recommendations
#####John Horrocks, manager at BlackBird Frame and Art
Smart and personable, reliable and enthusiastic. Tim is self-motivated, actively interested in studying a problem to seek a solution. He possesses the intellect to not only discover an answer but to effectively articulate his recommendations. He always accepted non-routine assignments willingly and approached every task with unusual energy. We were fortunate to have Tim as an employee, but always knew his destiny lied beyond our door.

#####Benjamin Cantil, professor at Berklee College of Music
In the time I've known Tim during last school term, he was an extraordinary leader in our department, and one of the most technically literate and creatively charged students on our campus.

As a technologist, Tim has an intuitive sense of picking up new programs. He is the type of inquisitive mind that is not simply satisfied with knowing how something works, but he also insists on figuring out why it works, and how to make it better. He was a leading innovator in our program, with ideas that expanded beyond the classroom content and down to the coding level of many programs we were using only on the surface.

As an artist, I recall an occasion where I was positively moved to speechlessness by a deeply soulful electronic-acoustic tune that a friend randomly had me listen to. It was not until the end of the song when I was informed that the piece of music was actually a composition of Tim's. Tim's creative intelligence is as vast as it is rare, and his musical gifts are an inspiration to students and teachers alike. Even more rare are those who have an intellectual capacity to break down and describe the mechanics of his process such as Tim does. Even sitting with him for five minutes will clue you in to the ocean of creative potential beneath the surface of this artist.

On top of his talents, Tim is easy to relate to and an all around great guy. During the school term he was elected by his peers to be a representative for his program, because everyone got along well with Tim and he actually listens when you speak to him.

Tim comes with my highest recommendation of any student I taught in this term.
